# RAG-powered-AI-chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/). This chatbot answers questions based on custom PDF documents.

## Project contribution 

This project was collaboratively built by [Sahil Nayak](https://github.com/sahilk12nayak), [Ankur Mishra](https://github.com/ankur110), [Iryna Lukysha](https://github.com/IrynaL-dev), and [Oluwajuwon](https://github.com/Oluwajuwon-O).

We worked together through a shared GitHub repository to design and implement the complete RAG-powered chatbot using LangChain, Streamlit, and a vector store. From document ingestion to LLM integration, and all components were collaboratively developed.

Our discussions, planning, and problem-solving were conducted primarily via Google Meet, which allowed us to align on architecture decisions, debug issues together, and maintain a smooth development workflow throughout the project.

   source myenv/bin/activate
2. Install dependencies
   python install -r requirement.txt
3. Add your document
   Put your .pdf files inside the docs/ folder.
4. Ingest documents
   python ingest.py
5. Set your LLM API key
